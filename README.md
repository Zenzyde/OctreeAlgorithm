# OctreeAlgorithm
A class-instance implementation of an octree structure, a small practice project because i was bored and a quadtree structure felt too easy XD

Visual example of the octree in action:

The class instance constructor:
![Octree class contructor](/images/create-octree-instance.png)
Parameters are as follows:
* The top-depth center position of the octree instance
* The top-depth radius of the octree instance
* The maximal amount of "nodes" or objects per octree-partition/quadrant
* The maximum depth or level of octree generations per octree-instance
